SQL
This assessment is designed to test your knowledge of fundamental SQL.

SQL Schema
There exist 2 tables in a SQL database accounts and branches. You will use these tables for each of the next 4 questions, although you may not need both tables for every question.

Each table follows the structure below:

Accounts
account_number	branch_id	account_type	balance	customer_name
98273	  		1			checking		2319.34	Timothy Fusterfieck
98274			1			checking		186.72	Kelsey Gordon
98276			2			checking		7.42	Alvaro Rojas
98277			3			checking		1532.72	Michael Alcocer
Branches
id	branch_name		city
1	Madrid Central	Madrid
2	Madrid Este		Madrid
3	Toledo Central	Toledo
branch_id in the accounts table is a foreign key to the branches table

Requirements
Write a SQL query to retreive the customer_name and balance of every account with an account_type of "checking"

SELECT customer_name, balance
FROM accounts
WHERE account_type = 'checking';

Requirements
Write a SQL query to display the average balance grouped by account type.
SELECT account_type, AVG(balance) AS average_balance
FROM accounts
GROUP BY account_type;

Requirements
Write a SQL query to retreive the customer_name and and the branch_name associated with each account.
SELECT c.customer_name, b.branch_name
FROM accounts AS c
INNER JOIN branches AS b
ON c.branch_id = b.id;

Requirements
Write a SQL query to display all the records from the Accounts table that are of checking account_type and have branch id of 2 .
We do not want information from all the columns. Please note your output should look like this, with the exact headers (aliases),
here case sensitive:

Name	account_type	balance
Alvaro Rojas	checking	7.42
James Potter	checking	25.83

SELECT customer_name AS Name, account_type, balance
FROM accounts
WHERE account_type = 'checking' AND branch_id = 2;
