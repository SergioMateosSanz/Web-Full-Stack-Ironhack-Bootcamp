This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.10.

## Requirements

You are creating a sneaker brand application using Angular. Your application must:

1. Allow users to add a new sneaker model.
2. Every sneaker must-have model name (string), price (number), special edition (boolean), author (string), creation date (Date), and artist collaborator (string).
3. Every field must be validated. Artist collaborator is an optional field but if is a special edition it must have an artist collaborator.
4. When a new sneaker is created you have to store it in a database and show it on a list page. Note: You can skip this step by adding it to a list below the form for simplicity.
5. You have to use material components in the design.
