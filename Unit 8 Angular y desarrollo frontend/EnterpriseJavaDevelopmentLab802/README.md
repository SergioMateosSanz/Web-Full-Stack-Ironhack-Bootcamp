2. Every field is required but occupation.
3. Content must be a textarea field and has a minimum length of 10 and a maximum length of 255 characters.
4. You must highlight all invalid fields and show error messages.
5. The email must be a valid email address.
6. After successful submission, you must disable all inputs and disable the submit button (you can only send the contact form successfully once).
