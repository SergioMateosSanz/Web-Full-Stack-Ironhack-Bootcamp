## Requirements

One of the most common UI patterns is known as the [Master-Detail view](https://webapphuddle.com/master-detail-ui-pattern-design/)

For this lab, you’ll build an employee directory application with a Master-Detail view. The design is up to you, but you must meet the specs below:

1. Build a database with a single employee’s table. Each Employee should have a name, phone number, office number, position, and manager.
2. Create a Spring Boot project with a GET route to get all employees.
3. Build an Angular app that displays the names of all employees in a list.
4. When an employee’s name is clicked, you must display all the details for that employee in another component.
5. In the detail component, there must be a delete button that will remove the employee from the list and the database.
